## Section 1: Inference about a mean
##------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# We would like to infer from a discrete number of measurements what the mean of the variable is had we measured continuously

# Problem of stat inference is when you want to say something about that complete data set (the population), but you only observe a relatively small portion of the data (the sample)

##------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Section 2: Sampling distribution of mean and variance
##------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Sampling distribution of the sample mean - distriubtion of means of a bunch of samples

# The mean of a sample is on average a good estimate of the pop mean

# We can also have the sampling distribution of the sample variance

# population - all values, both observed and unobserved
